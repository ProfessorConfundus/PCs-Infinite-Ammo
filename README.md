# PC's Infinite Ammo

A Factorio mod that adds versions of all vanilla weapon ammunition that can never run out/get consumed. This mod is clearly very, very cheaty, if you can't already tell.

## Notes

This mod has not been tested to be compatible with multiplayer, and has had no thought put into the design to make it such.
