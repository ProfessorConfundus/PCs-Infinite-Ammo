# PC's Infinite Ammo

A Factorio mod that adds versions of all vanilla weapon ammunition that can never run out/get consumed. This mod is clearly very, very cheaty, if you can't already tell.

## Notes

This mod has not been tested to be compatible with multiplayer, and has had no thought put into the design to make it such.

## Contributing

Feel free to make a pull request to this repository. I don't really feel the need to have any contributing guidelines. *With that said*, however, if you are considering/want to add versions for another mod's ammunition, please discuss it with me beforehand.
